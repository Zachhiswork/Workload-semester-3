# Drag and Drop Game

## Overview

This project is a simple Drag and Drop game designed for the Front-End Development (FED) class. The goal is to create an interactive game allowing users to drag differently colored boxes between panels, reinforcing concepts of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Development Process

### Coding

The development process involved exploring JavaScript methods and utilizing drag events to create an engaging game. In-depth DOM manipulation concepts were applied, resulting in a functional and visually appealing game that demonstrates the versatility of JavaScript.

### File Structure

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the webpage structure, including a header, a draggable block panel, and additional drop targets.
  
- **CSS (`index.css`):** Provides styles for visual presentation and layout, enhancing the user experience.

- **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Implements the game logic, defining draggable elements and drop targets. Utilizes drag and drop event listeners and the DataTransfer API for efficient data handling during operations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Dependencies

- No external libraries or frameworks are used.
- Compatible with modern web browsers.

## Compatibility

The Drag and Drop game is designed to work seamlessly across various modern web browsers, providing users with an accessible and enjoyable experience.
